# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool that dynamically visualizes various sorting algorithms using animated bar charts. It helps users understand the inner workings of sorting algorithms like **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and more. The tool also provides real-time insights into the **time complexity** of these algorithms, making it a valuable educational resource for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: See sorting algorithms step by step with animated bar charts.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Supports popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.
- **Time Complexity Insights**: Displays real-time information about the time complexity of each algorithm.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting visualization to observe changes at different paces.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI designed for ease of use.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with various screen sizes, making it accessible on mobile and desktop.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in any browser.

3. Choose the desired sorting algorithm and start the visualization.

4. Use the control options to adjust the speed or reset the array for a new run.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating an engaging UI.
- **JavaScript**: To implement sorting algorithms and dynamically update the DOM for visualizations.

## Advantages

- **Educational**: Helps learners understand sorting algorithms through hands-on visualization.
- **Dynamic Learning**: Provides real-time feedback and insights, making it easier to grasp DSA concepts.
- **Customization**: Users can control the sorting speed and reset the array for multiple tests.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify.
